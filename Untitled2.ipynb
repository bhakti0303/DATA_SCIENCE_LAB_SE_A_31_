        "The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in artificial intelligence, game theory, and robotics. It is particularly used for two-player zero-sum games (where one player's gain is another's loss) such as chess, checkers, and Tic-Tac-Toe. The goal of Minimax is to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that the opponent also plays optimally.\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm works by recursively exploring the game tree, evaluating each possible move and its consequences. It assigns a score to each terminal (game-over) state. For non-terminal states, it alternates between two phases:\n",
